Random issues
=============

Docs fail to build sometimes
----------------------------

e.g. see https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=giac specifically:

- 1.2.3.25+dfsg1-3 armhf mipsel failed (amd64 succeeded)
- 1.2.3.25+dfsg1-2 armhf mipsel succeeded

grep the logs for "Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!", these
seem to be due to extra "$$$" in algo_.tex, generated by HEVEA from algo.tex.
Only two $$ is allowed and is what exists in algo.tex

Probably a HEVEA problem but I can't be bothered chasing it down further, the
build scripts and code are too messy to deal with.
