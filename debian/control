Package: libgiac0
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: giac-doc
Description: Computer Algebra System C++ library
 Giac is a computer algebra system, following the development of the CAS for HP
 calculators. It has fast implementation of algorithms for polynomial
 operations, and compatibility mode with Maple or Mupad CAS as well as TI
 calculators.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs using giac.
